# challenge-site

This is the backend repo for ChallengeHub. This repo was apart of our Hack for BattleHacks Toronto. This consists of the front-end which was built with Node and the GithubAPI.
Our Github API integrations allow Comapnies to create challenges through our app which automatically open Github issues.
Our integration also allows Developers to accept challenges through our app which automatically forks the repo for the User.
Our integration also allows Developers to automatically create pull requests once they are done a challenge.
Our backend keeps track of challenges from open, in progress, to complete for both companies and developers.

ChallengeHub was a hack for BattleHacks Toronto which focuses on enabling technology companies to build great open source commmunites around their open source projects.

ChallengeHub is a web application that allows companies to create "challenges" with the option of monetary prizes for extra incentive. These challenges could be new features or bug fixes to a company's open source repo.

So here's something you may be thinking: Why did we build this?

We built this because as developers using open source software we've always felt that sometimes there isn't enough incentive for developers to contribute to open source projects. We've always found great Open Source projects that have alot of unaddressed issues because there isn't enough developer support.

We've also felt that as developers, it's always difficult to quantitatively measure how good developer X is by his resume. We thought that this would be great way for companies to get better insight into the hiring process by tracking the contributions that a potential employee is currently giving to your projects. As an employer you can directly see the impact a developer has made to software that millions of developers around the world could be potentially using.

Also from a hiring standpoint, with real code and a large code base, you can measure see someone's engineering skills at work. You can see how someone can: navigate through a large code base, breakdown a problem, overcome barriers to make innovative solutions, write good maintainable code and deliver value to you instantly.
